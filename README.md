# SKY ATTACK v1.0

This is a console based game named "SKY ATTACK" version 1.0. The game is based
on a shooting craft and it shoots enemy crafts coming towards it. This game has been
developed using C++ language.

The strength of C++ when it comes to game development is the ability to exactly layout the
data-structures that the software use. When performance real-time systems (such as
games) started growing, it was the most commonly supported and most developed
programming language. C++ provides the ability to override important performance
bottlenecks such as memory allocation. It has the ability to structure and place things exactly
where they want in the memory. On top of this it's a flexible programming language that
provides a decent development velocity. So, this game has been developed the basic C++
programming.

## IMPROVEMENTS

- In this game, when we press ESC the game will disappear and comes to the main menu.
But normally the escape function does not quit the game, but it pauses the game till we
resume. Therefore, we can develop this game to that state. Then the user is able to pause
the game for a while without exiting from it.
- If the game is at the same difficulty level player can gets bored when playing for a long
time. So, we can develop this game to become more difficult or harder when a player
scoring continuously. Then a player would not go for a higher score easily and it will
become more adventurous.
- It is better if we can design the shooting machine as which is able to rotate and spread
the bullets.
- Our shooting machine can be modified as a machine that having a health level and when
it gets shot the health level gradually decreases. And also, we can drop a medical pack
from time to time which we can catch and increase its health.
- Now the game is displayed in a defined area. We can improve this to full screen display,
and it is more comfortable to the player.
- Game should have different firing and exploding sounds.
- Graphics can be seen in 2D or 3D with higher bitrate details colorfully.
- Ability to save player profiles. It is easy to play again without typing the name again and
again.
