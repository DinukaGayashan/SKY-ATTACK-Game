# SKY ATTACK v1.0

This is a console based game named "SKY ATTACK" version 1.0. The game is based
on a shooting craft and it shoots enemy crafts coming towards it. This game has been
developed using C++ language.

The strength of C++ when it comes to game development is the ability to exactly layout the
data-structures that the software use. When performance real-time systems (such as
games) started growing, it was the most commonly supported and most developed
programming language. C++ provides the ability to override important performance
bottlenecks such as memory allocation. It has the ability to structure and place things exactly
where they want in the memory. On top of this it's a flexible programming language that
provides a decent development velocity. So, this game has been developed the basic C++
programming.
